Over time, I realized that working with data and creating analytical solutions always excited me, which led me to shift my focus to this field.\n\nTo pursue this passion, I attended a six-month language program at the University of Arkansas in the USA, followed by earning a master's degree in Data Engineering at Jacobs (Constructor) University in Bremen, Germany.\n\nCurrently, I work as a Data Engineer in the Artificial Intelligence Unit of the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization, and Climate Change in Turkey, where I enjoy leveraging the power of data to develop meaningful solutions.",
